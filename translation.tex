\subsection{Idea}

We can now consider the possibility of a shallow embedding of ETT in LambdaPi.
Since we need to construct terms that behave like MLTT, we can start with the
shallow embedding of MLTT described section \ref{mltt-shallow}. One could then
hope to add clever enough reduction rule to this encoding to make the reflexion
rule hold for its types. But this face a fundamental problem~: type checking is
undecidable in ETT, while it is decidable in LambdaPi. So if we could have an
embedding that is just the identity on term, we would have a decidable
typechecking algorithm for ETT, which is impossible.
